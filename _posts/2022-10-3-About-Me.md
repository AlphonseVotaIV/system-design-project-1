About Me:

Hi! My name is Alphonse Vota, and I'm a junior studying Cybersecurity here at Marist College! I'm hoping to join an internship over this coming winter break in my field, that way I can gain some field experience for the future. When I'm not doing work, I like to play video games such as Deep Rock Galactic, Terraria, and ULTRAKILL. I also like to collect gemstones, of which I'm hoping to go to Tucson, AZ in the future to burn a hole in my pocket with how much I want to spend there!
