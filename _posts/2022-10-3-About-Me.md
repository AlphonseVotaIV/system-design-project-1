About Me:

Hi! My name is Alphonse Vota, and I'm a junior studying Cybersecurity here at Marist College! I'm hoping to join an internship over this coming winter break in my field, that way I can gain some field experience for the future. When I'm not doing work, I like to play video games such as Deep Rock Galactic, Terraria, and ULTRAKILL. I also like to collect gemstones, of which I'm hoping to go to Tucson, AZ in the future to burn a hole in my pocket with how much I want to spend there! I also participated in my high school's bowling team, of which my highest score was a 194.

Here's an image of me from my sophomore year.

As a bonus image, here's when I got a 7-10 split with all the pins up when me and a group of my bowling friends were goofing around.

In my resume page, I forked a repository from Github and input my own details into the markdown file, then dragged it into here. I attempted to get the CSS to work, but it has yet to function correctly. Credits to Eliseo Papa, with the original repository link right <a href="(https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv)">here</a>.
