In Lesson 3, I learned about Frameworks, and how important they are for making professional-looking websites quickly. A Framework is a block of code written by someone else for you to easily incorporate into the design of your website. I also learned about and used Bootstrap, which is a framework that allows you to build off of a template and make it your website. In Lab 2, I had to make my website, so I used a Bootstrap layout I found online named Grayscale and edited it enough to make it my own. 

The image for the website is below:
