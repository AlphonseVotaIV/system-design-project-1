At the beginning of Lesson 2, I didn’t have to worry about installing anything new, since I already use Visual Studio Code as my IDE and Git as my version control system. I then learned of the different strategies within the industry, and how they operate. They are Trunk-Based Development, Feature Branches, and Git Flow. Within Trunk-Based Development, there’s a single branch in which a team makes their local repository and pushes their changes to the branch. This allows for seamless execution of their updating their master branch. Within Feature Branches, the individuals in a team make their branch from the master branch, of which they would work on their select portion of their project, and then push it back to the main branch. In Git Flow, multiple branches are created to individualize tasks and space them out. This allows for multiple users to work on different portions of the same code, albeit a bit haphazardly, as things can get out of hand if users submit different portions of code that have merge conflicts.
