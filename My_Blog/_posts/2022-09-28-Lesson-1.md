In Lesson 1, I learned about how the differences between Git and Github, how the latter works, used the different Github functions, and learned how to set up GitHub Pages. Git is the version control system, and functions as the machine that handles the commits going in and out of the system; while GitHub is a website that acts as a way for you to direct those Git commits into a repository hosted on the Github.com website. Within GitHub, you’re able to create, fork, clone, and delete repositories, of which you can host a centralized area for open-source projects on. Through forks and branches, GitHub allows team members to branch out and do their line of code, and push/merge it back into the tree of commits your team works on.

When I was done learning the information, I had to do a lab for Lesson 1. In it, I went over the different functions within Github, such as learning how to create and fork a repository, as well as setting up a GitHub Pages website. Within GitHub Pages, a user can host a website directly on Github’s website within their repository for free. 

Below is an image of my Github Pages website from my first lab.

Looks horrible, right?
